******************TestNG*******************
TestNG:
is a testing tool that helps us to structure our test cases using different annotations

Benefits of testNG:
1.Reports
2.Annotations  e.g @Test, @before ,@beforeclass
3.parallel testing
4.batch execution
5.Assertions--> Hard Assertions , SoftAssertions
6.Data Parameterization

it can be integrated with cucumber , maven and selenium.



1.Annotations:
we donot need any main method

annotation is a tag that provides additional inforamtion about class, interface or method in testNG
anotation are used to keep the strucutre of test cases

@Test
@BeforeMethod
@AfterMethod
@BeforeClass
@AfterClass


1.@Test
You should write your test cases under this annotation.
This is the main annotation in testNG
By default testNG excutes the methods in alphabetical order.


2.@BeforeMethod:
runs every time before the @test is executed
also called precondition

3.@AfterMethod:
runs after each @test Method
also called post condition


before method is preconditon that must run before every test case and the post conditon will run after
the test case has ended

priority:
by deafault the priority is zero of all the test case
in order to give them a priority order
use @Test(priority =1)


Enabled:
@Test(enabled=false)--> will not run the test cases that are set false
by deafult all test cases are set to enabled=true

DependsOn:

@Test(dependsOnMethods = "methodName")
will only run if the depndent method has passed successfully else it will be skipped




HardAssertions:
we have hardAssertions in testNG
in order to use the assertion we use

Assert.assertiontype()

1.Assert.Assertequals(String1, String2);
it passes if String1 equals String2
if fails if String1 doesnot equals to string2

2.Assert.Asserttrue(boolean variable);
check the state of a boolean variable
it passes if the boolean is TRUE
it fails if the boolean is False


In hard aseertions if we have multiple assertions
as soon as one of them fails it quits checking other assertions and declared the test case has failed


SoftAssertions:
soft assertion continue to check all the assertions regardless of the fact even if one or more assertions
have failed, which is not the sceanrio in case of HArd Assertions (they stop execution when even one assertion fails).

in order to use soft assertion
1.declaration

SoftAssert soft =new SoftAssert();

2.soft.AssertEquals(string, string)  instead of Asser.AssertEquals(string,string)

at the end u must do

3.soft.Assertall().





After the declaration when u use soft.assert it just checks the assertion but does not take any action or display any output.
once tall the assertions are done
then u use soft.Assertall()
to compile the result of all the assertion and show you the results on screen.





how to create a git repo

1.navigate to the location where ur project is.
2.Decide where to create the repo
NO SUBREPOSITORIES-->please :)

3.initalize the repo using     git init

4. git add .
5. git commit -m "message"




remote repo
warnings:
one local repo must have only one remote repo

1.git remote -v  (check if the connection is there or not)
2.git remote add origin URL
3.git branch -M main

for a new repo
all these above steps u only need to don once never again

git push -u origin main  (first time)
git push   (after the first time)

What Is TestNG.Xml?
TestNG.xml file is a configuration file that helps in organizing our tests.
It allows testers to create and handle multiple test classes, define test suites and tests.

It makes a tester’s job easier by controlling the execution of
 tests by putting all the test cases together and run it under one XML file.
  This is a beautiful concept, without which, it is difficult to work in TestNG.

Advantages Of TestNG.xml
Major advantages of TestNG.xml file are:

It provides parallel execution of test methods.
It allows the dependency of one test method on another test method.
It helps in prioritizing our test methods.
It allows grouping of test methods into test groups.
It supports the parameterization of test cases using @Parameters annotation.
It helps in Data-driven testing using @DataProvider annotation.
It has different types of assertions that help in validating the expected results with the actual results.
It has different types of HTML reports, Extent reports, etc. for a better and clear understanding of our test summary.
It has listeners who help in creating logs.

Concepts Used In TestNG.xml
#1) A Suite is represented by one XML file. It can contain one or more tests and is defined by the <suite> tag.

Example: <suite name=”Testing Google Apps”>

#2) A Test is represented by <test> and can contain one or more TestNG classes.

Example: <test name=”Regression”>

#3) A Class is a Java class that contains TestNG annotations. Here it is represented by the <class> tag and can contain one or more test methods.

testNg XML:
 gives u control over the execution of your whole project!!!!!!

<suite>
	<test>

		<classes>
			<class>

				<method>
				     <include =" method name"/>
				</method>
			</class>
		</classes>



		<packages>

		<packages>

	</test>
</suite>



1.Class wise execution
you can control which class u want to execute using xml , u can execute multiple classes also
e.g
for one class
<suite name="All Test Suite">
    <test verbose="2" preserve-order="true" name="C:/Users/moazzam/Desktop/testNGbatch12new/TestNGBasicsBatch12">
      <classes>
          <class name="class01.BasicAnnotations"></class>

      </classes>
    </test>
</suite>

for two classes
<suite name="All Test Suite">
    <test verbose="2" preserve-order="true" name="C:/Users/moazzam/Desktop/testNGbatch12new/TestNGBasicsBatch12">
      <classes>
          <class name="class01.Priorities"></class>
           <class name="class01.DependsOn"></class>
      </classes>
    </test>
</suite>





2.Mehtod wise execution
you can control which method in a particular class to execute and which not to by using xml in testng
e.g:
<suite name="All Test Suite">
    <test verbose="2" preserve-order="true" name="test">
       <classes>
           <class name="class01.BasicAnnotations">
               <methods>
                   <include name="bthirdTest"/>
                   <exclude name="cfourthTest"/>
               </methods>
           </class>
       </classes>
    </test>
</suite>

here it will execute just the method bthird test located in class Basicannotations
exclude elimantes all the methods u name , helps u actively run or not run a test case by xml


3.Package wise execution
you can run all the classes in one package using xml
e.g
<suite name="All Test Suite">
    <test verbose="2" preserve-order="true" name="TestNGBasicsBatch12">
    <packages>
        <package name="class02"></package>
    </packages>
    </test>
</suite>




Important points
1.you can not run duplicate classes in one test
<test verbose="2" preserve-order="true" name="test">
       <classes>
           <class name="class01.BasicAnnotations">
            <class name="class01.BasicAnnotations">
           </class>
       </classes>
    </test>
---->will not run it twice
2.in order to run a class mutiple times declare two test separatley
<test verbose="2" preserve-order="true" name="test">
       <classes>
           <class name="class01.BasicAnnotations">
       </classes>
    </test>
    <test verbose="2" preserve-order="true" name="test">
       <classes>
           <class name="class01.BasicAnnotations">
       </classes>
    </test>

--> will work



@BeforeClass:
this annotation is used to excute the method only once before the execution of the class

@AfterClass:
this annotation is used to excute the method only once after the execution of the class


@BeforeTest:
this annotation is used to excute the method only once before the execution of classes



@Aftertest:
this annotation is used to excute the method only once after the execution of classes



whenever we run by groups
the @beforeMethod and @after methods do not run
becuase they are not under the tag of groups


When we ran by method name
@before method and aftermethod runs
